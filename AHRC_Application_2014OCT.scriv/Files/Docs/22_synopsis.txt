You should provide information about the process of technical development, showing how the standards and formats described in section 2.a and the hardware and software described in section 2.b relate to each other. You must show that you have considered how you will achieve your digital output or digital technology in practice, including issues of timetabling.

You should consider the technical development process from the point of data capture or data creation through to final delivery (in the case of a digital output) or analysis (in the case of a digital process). You should consider issues such as backup, monitoring, quality control and internal documentation where relevant, identifying procedures which are appropriate to the research environment. For example Technical Reviewers acknowledge that the backup procedures which are possible during fieldwork might be very different to those which are possible within an office environment.

This section needs to relate to the timetable and milestones given in the Case for Support as well as the projectâ€™s overall research methodology.  The Technical Reviewer will be assessing the alignment of the technical development process with other project activities for logic and timeliness.
