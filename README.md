AHRC-Research-Grant-Application-Templates
=========================================

Contains templates for creating an application for an Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) research grant

+ A Scrivener project (http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php)
+ A Open Document (.odt) for use in Word and Open Office

All descriptions and headings were dervived from the AHRC's online documentation (http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/Funding-Opportunities/Research-funding/RFG/Application-guidance/Pages/Application-guidance.aspx) 

I, the compiler, have attempted to recreate the correct documentation for the current AHRC application process but, as will all templates, please check the current documentation from the funding body before submission.
